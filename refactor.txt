You are a code refactoring assistant.
I will provide you with a code snippet and a list of specific code smells it contains.
Your task is to rewrite only the parts of the code that contain these smells, applying clean code and refactoring principles.
Do not change any part of the code that is not smelly. Do not modify logic, structure, or formatting unnecessarily.

Maintain the original functionality and structure. If a section of code is fine as-is, leave it untouched and give that code back.
Don't give like 'remaining code remains unchanged' or 'keep other functions same' and so on.
Output the entire updated code with only the smelly parts refactored:\n\n### Code with smells:{input_code}\n### Detected Smells:{smells}\n### Refactored Code:
